  Many naturally occurring dynamical systems have symmetries or preserved quantities (just think of systems with preserved angles, invariance under rotation etc.). Roughly, integrable systems are Hamiltonian dynamical systems that admit a maximal number of independent symmetries/ preserved quantities.

  In 1988, Delzant symplectically classified toric integrable systems by means of their momentum map image which is a very nice and special convex polytope, often referred to as `Delzant polytope' of the toric system.

  Semitoric systems are integrable systems of the form $F=(J,H): (M, \omega) \to \mathbb{R}$ where $(M, \omega)$ is a 4-dimensional connected symplectic manifold and $J$ is proper and induces an effective Hamiltonian torus action and $F$ admits only nondegenerate singularities and no hyperbolic components. Intuitively, semitoric systems generalize toric systems in dimension four by admitting in addition to elliptic-elliptic and elliptic-regular singularities also focus-focus singularities. In 2009-2011, Pelayo $\&$ Vu Ngoc symplecticaly classified semitoric integrable systems in terms of 5 invariants, among which a `generalized semitoric polytope' deduced from the momentum map image, i.e. generalizing the Delzant polytope.

  When admitting also hyperbolic components for the nondegenerate singularities and mildly degenerate (so-called parabolic) points, then one generalizes semitoric systems to so-called hypersemitoric systems. The long term goal is to obtain a classification of hypersemitoric integrable systems on compact connected 4-dimensional symplectic manifolds.

  This talk presents one of the expected invariants, the so-called `affine invariant' which is the generalization of the semitoric polytope invariant. This talk is based on ongoing work with N. Flamand (Antwerp) and a joint preprint (arXiv:2411.17509) with K. Efstathiou (Duke Kunshan University) and P. Santos (Antwerp).
