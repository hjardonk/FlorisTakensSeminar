  In this talk, we will review the representation theory of the quantum group Oq(SL2). We will present how to use knot diagrams to represent representations  of Oq(SL2). We will then look at the relations in these knot diagrams obtained from the representation theory of Oq(SL2). At the end of this talk, it will be clear how we derive Kauffman bracket relations via Oq(SL2).
