  The tube of radius r around a submanifold is the set of all points within distance r of the submanifold. In this talk, we discuss the volume of a tube around a submanifold in sub-Riemannian geometry. Firstly, we show that the volume of the tube around a non-characteristic submanifold of class $C^2$ is either smooth or real-analytic for small radii, depending on the regularity of the underlying manifold, and we establish a Weyl's tube formula. Secondly, we investigate Weyl's invariance theorem in sub-Riemannian geometry: we show that two curves in the Heisenberg group with the same Reeb angle have the same Weyl's tube formula. This is a joint work with T. Bossio and L. Rizzi.
