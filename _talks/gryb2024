  A significant and persistent arrow of time is expressed in our universe by means of two important facts: the rapid and monotonic decrease of the red-shift and the relative smoothness of the early matter distribution. In this talk, I will show that an explanation can be given for these phenomena when the theory is expressed invariantly under a particular kind of scale symmetry. This explanation is given in terms of dynamically privileged states along generic solutions that lie on attractors and so-called "Janus points." A preferred temporal direction can be defined using such structures for observers in states close to an attractor. I will show how such a scenario can be realised in two models of the universe in a way that explains the properties of the red-shift and early matter distribution of the universe. Surprisingly, removing the relevant scale symmetry leads to flows on state space that do not preserve the measure. For N-body gravitational systems, this time dependence leads to the remarkable conclusion that 'early' states near a Janus point are typically smooth while most clumpy states occur near 'late'-time attractors.
