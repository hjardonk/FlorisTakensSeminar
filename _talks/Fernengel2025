  Master equations play a crucial role in natural science, as they describe the time evolution of probability distributions of all systems that can be modeled as directed, weighted graphs. 
Despite their essential role, computing a solution is often avoided and authors refer to numerical methods or approximation techniques instead.

We present both a mathematically sound framework for master equations on a discrete, countable configuration space as well as sufficient conditions the generator of the master equation must have for the time limit t -> infinity to converge, which is not guaranteed on an infinite dimensional space. 

We discuss the assumptions for the possibility of interchanging the thermodynamic limit and the time limit. This makes it possible to obtain the long-term behavior of an infinite system from a thermodynamic limit of stationary solutions of corresponding finite subnetworks. 

Our method is demonstrated by a few examples of master equations, such as linear, infinitely long chains, with one- and two open ends.
